As a user, I want to add a toilet to let others know features and quality


Bronze Features:
As a user, I go the landing page "index" so that I see the:
  title of the app,
  the developers section "about page",
  the add toilet "new page",
  the find toilet button "map page", and map button "map page"


As a user, I go from the index to the new page by clicking "add a toilet" button in order to document the attributes for that specific toilet into following categories: location, cleansliness, accessibility, wait time, overall rating, and comments

As a user, I click "submit" on the new page which stores my toilet submission and redirects to the show page

As a user on the show page, I see the stored toilet features in the following order from top to bottom: Rating, Cleansliness, Accessibility (handicap, unisex), Avg. Rating, comments

As a user on the show page, I click the "add comment" button at the bottom that lets me comment under the initial submission

As a user, I go to the new page and click on the map image to see all the toilets that have been added
As a user, I click on a pin that takes to the show page of that toilet location
